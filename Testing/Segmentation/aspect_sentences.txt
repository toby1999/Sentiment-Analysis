It has been a fascinating subject to learn and very rewarding
The pace of learning and materials are spot on
The course is brilliant, very interactive
Theory is brought to life in debates
Best move I made is signing up
A thoroughly enjoyable course, professionally run and organised with all aspects of students needs being met
Everything is simply explained and achievable
The content has been carefully considered so as not to overwhelm the student and is introduced at the appropriate stages
Regular checking of knowledge and understanding is carried out and any ambiguity is covered and backed up with practical and simple examples
I am thoroughly enjoying this course
It covers an awful lot more than I thought it would
The course is very well put together and Gary is so informative and patient and helpful that he delivers it fantastically
Gary makes me feel at ease and confident to ask questions which is everything that I usually struggle with
Highly recommend to anyone and everyone
Amazing course and Gary is very easy to listen to and its comfortable to chat/ ask questions/ interact as a group
Stimulating and interesting
Positive learning environment
Brilliant!  I'm getting so much out of the course both personally and professionally
I'm excited about what I've learnt and feel that it has completely changed me as a person in an unbelievably positive way
This course is engaging and extremely informative
This course has changed my life
Understanding how my own brain works has changed my outlook on life for the better
The lecturers make really hard neuroscience stuff to understand and explain it in a way that you can understand it
I have already been recommending this course to anyone who will listen
Thank you!
I'm absolutely loving this course
Learning to be a hypnotherapist in such a supportive group is great! The course is very well presented with excellent course notes and peer support
Gary and the team make sure we have fun too sometimes
Otherwise love everything !
The course and the trainer were fantastic
I would highly recommend this course to anyone aspiring to be a clinical hypnotherapist
The course was brilliant
It was engaging from beginning to end and we learned all the tools and knowledge to set up a practice immediately
Fantastic course, well structured
Trainer knowledgeable as he is a practitioner too so that's great
I am really enjoying the course
The tutors are  knowledgeable and approachable
I am looking forward to the rest of the course and feel confident about putting all my learning into practice
An amazing course
Right from the first weekend you are given actionable content that dramatically increases your knowledge of your own brain, and gives you insight into how you can start to help others
I feel like a missing piece of me has finally slotted into place
Good course, well delivered, easily understood
Transferable skills for use inside and outside of work
I enjoyed the introduction to couching and it is seriously making me think about completing another level
The course was very well planned, starting off with the fundamentals and progressing to the coaching practice on the second day
Course content was very good
Plenty of information on booklet provided by trainer
usually I struggle on day courses in the afternoon , but my concentration was good all day and took a huge amount from the day which has linked in to my ILAM level 3 apprenticeship which I am  currently  completing
I think everyone would benefit from taking this course to allow better understanding of H&S
Having the insights report as part of this training was invaluable as well as being a added extra that you can really study and understand who you are as a manager
Lack of tea and coffee from the venue hosts is the only downside!!
The booking could be better, there was no official correspondence the tell us about the course until just before the course started, I think if there was a generic email once you‚Äôve paid the deposit to say what to expect - ie: thanks for booking, we‚Äôll be in touch a week before the start of the course we‚Äôd not worry about not hearing before
Proof reading the handouts a little better would be an improvement
There are a number of typos which can put you off your flow if undetected before you start reading
The facilities could do with a good clean
Coffee not great quality
Admin- on issues
Fell the course is to long I know you are fitting a lot in one session but was starting to lose concentration towards the end
Also it would be useful to have print out of the power point slides to keep in the folder as my hand written notes make not make much sense when looking back in the future
Would prefer to have some hand outs - as it would be easier to follow the content
would prefer o have source material or highlights to review before course
The only thing that I would criticise is that I wish I left with some more actionable steps on how to implement what we learned in terms of coaching and how to practice it
The noise from the ongoing building work outside is quite loud and distracting
Where I have marked the scores down slightly on the above would possibly be more down to my expectation of the course in terms of it's relevance to me which isn't so much a criticism of the course as it is just the fact that some of it wasn't relevant to me
I felt the course could have been more specific into the duties and responsibilities of a H&S Representative
The tools necessary to conduct this role effectively were only touched on and too much time was spent talking about legal structure rather than talking about what legislation and prosecution methods are relevant to H&S
I would have liked more detail on reporting on incidents and the importance of doing so emphasised to the attendees
Felt that the course content needed to be adjusted
The room was a little small and we had to have our lunch in it
Nicer to be able to go to a different space for lunch and then return to training as hard to spend all day in one small room
Filming us would of been a useful addition to the course in order to fully critique our own presentations
Hopefully they will be shared as the projection was a bit off and the left of the slides cut off making some difficult to read
I don't think the course warranted a whole folder, let alone one that was of a style that it couldn't be reused
Re Certificate of attendance question below - I have not had a certificate
Perhaps the brief given for the course was wrong
Certainly didn't meet my expectations, though may have met the brief?
I would have preferred slide handouts, especially where we were discussing the different models to leadership
Handouts had been reused so answers were already on the sheet
The printed version of the notes did not seem to have the full presentation
The course material pages handed out to us where old and had all the answers written on them by previous students
The excuse given to us was that the trainer wanted to save trees by not printing them all the time
I find this quite unprofessional
As above the course is far too short for the information you have to learn
It should also be open book exam
you can not retain all the information in a course that this short
NEBOSH training needs to be updated to allow for people like me that have dyslexia, we can not cope with all this hand writing and spelling, I and others like be never do very well in exams like this, we learn differently than the mainstream
Computers has helped me over the years, so I cannot understand why exams cant be done on computers, this would be a massive help
I think allowing the group to decline role play was probably an error since a lot of the content seemed geared that way
As my comments above, I feel as though an understanding of Visualsoft and how the company has set up their policies would have given this more context
There was no direction for the course, it felt like it was a discussion which could have taken place over half a day
There didn't seem much guidance and it was more direct at difficult conversations with clients, whereas more of the difficult conversations are with employees
I was booked to attend this course November 2018 and was advised that the course was cancelled due to lack of numbers attending that particular session
On day one, the training was cancelled, I got word of this at 09:50, 40 minutes before training was due to start
I went to work that day very unprepared for a day at the office
At no stage was this communicated and found this to have been very disruptive and it was almost 11am before formal training commenced and one delegate could not commit to attending the third day due to her work commitments
Cosesna should have made better effort to communicate these changes on what was supposed to be day one, to each of the delegates
This last minute change impacted on the other end of the day and training ran over the 16:30 finish time, on both this day and the next day which caused disruption to childcare and I had also to rearrange work and home commitments to ensure I was able to attend third day on the Friday
There was a notable absence of effective communication from cosensa to the delegates
No lunch was served
Could maybe be more content on coaching in different every day work place scenarios
