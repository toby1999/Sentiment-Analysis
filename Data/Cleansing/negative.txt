Lack of tea and coffee from the venue hosts is the only downside!!
The booking could be better, there was no official correspondence the tell us about the course until just before the course started, I think if there was a generic email once you‚Äôve paid the deposit to say what to expect - ie: thanks for booking, we‚Äôll be in touch a week before the start of the course we‚Äôd not worry about not hearing before
Proof reading the handouts a little better would be an improvement
There are a number of typos which can put you off your flow if undetected before you start reading
The facilities could do with a good clean
Coffee not great quality
Admin- on issues
Fell the course is to long I know you are fitting a lot in one session but was starting to lose concentration towards the end
Also it would be useful to have print out of the power point slides to keep in the folder as my hand written notes make not make much sense when looking back in the future
Would prefer to have some hand outs - as it would be easier to follow the content
would prefer o have source material or highlights to review before course
The only thing that I would criticise is that I wish I left with some more actionable steps on how to implement what we learned in terms of coaching and how to practice it
The noise from the ongoing building work outside is quite loud and distracting
Where I have marked the scores down slightly on the above would possibly be more down to my expectation of the course in terms of it's relevance to me which isn't so much a criticism of the course as it is just the fact that some of it wasn't relevant to me
I felt the course could have been more specific into the duties and responsibilities of a H&S Representative
The tools necessary to conduct this role effectively were only touched on and too much time was spent talking about legal structure rather than talking about what legislation and prosecution methods are relevant to H&S
I would have liked more detail on reporting on incidents and the importance of doing so emphasised to the attendees
Felt that the course content needed to be adjusted
The room was a little small and we had to have our lunch in it
Nicer to be able to go to a different space for lunch and then return to training as hard to spend all day in one small room
Filming us would of been a useful addition to the course in order to fully critique our own presentations
Hopefully they will be shared as the projection was a bit off and the left of the slides cut off making some difficult to read
I don't think the course warranted a whole folder, let alone one that was of a style that it couldn't be reused
Re Certificate of attendance question below - I have not had a certificate
Perhaps the brief given for the course was wrong
Certainly didn't meet my expectations, though may have met the brief?
I would have preferred slide handouts, especially where we were discussing the different models to leadership
Handouts had been reused so answers were already on the sheet
The printed version of the notes did not seem to have the full presentation
The course material pages handed out to us where old and had all the answers written on them by previous students
The excuse given to us was that the trainer wanted to save trees by not printing them all the time
I find this quite unprofessional
As above the course is far too short for the information you have to learn
It should also be open book exam
you can not retain all the information in a course that this short
NEBOSH training needs to be updated to allow for people like me that have dyslexia, we can not cope with all this hand writing and spelling, I and others like be never do very well in exams like this, we learn differently than the mainstream
Computers has helped me over the years, so I cannot understand why exams cant be done on computers, this would be a massive help
I think allowing the group to decline role play was probably an error since a lot of the content seemed geared that way
As my comments above, I feel as though an understanding of Visualsoft and how the company has set up their policies would have given this more context
There was no direction for the course, it felt like it was a discussion which could have taken place over half a day
There didn't seem much guidance and it was more direct at difficult conversations with clients, whereas more of the difficult conversations are with employees
I was booked to attend this course November 2018 and was advised that the course was cancelled due to lack of numbers attending that particular session
On day one, the training was cancelled, I got word of this at 09:50, 40 minutes before training was due to start
I went to work that day very unprepared for a day at the office
At no stage was this communicated and found this to have been very disruptive and it was almost 11am before formal training commenced and one delegate could not commit to attending the third day due to her work commitments
Cosesna should have made better effort to communicate these changes on what was supposed to be day one, to each of the delegates
This last minute change impacted on the other end of the day and training ran over the 16:30 finish time, on both this day and the next day which caused disruption to childcare and I had also to rearrange work and home commitments to ensure I was able to attend third day on the Friday
There was a notable absence of effective communication from cosensa to the delegates
No lunch was served
Could maybe be more content on coaching in different every day work place scenarios
Too many videos
Content a little repetitive
Unfortunately we couldn't watch the video due to IT issues and I felt we could have spent longer on bad vs good influencing behaviours
00  Lynda was very good instructor though and perhaps more interactive material such as video and role play could have been used
Whilst I appreciate this training was delivered on a one-to-one basis, I felt the actual training environment and equipment was not appropriate - the chairs were not computer operator chairs and didn't provide adequate back support and laptops were used rather than desktop PCs, which meant the monitor wasn't at a suitable height which wasn't really appropriate for a full day's training
When I turned up the lights were off and the tutor wasn't there
The computers were difficult to get going and two of them had unlicensed excel on it which means we couldn't open a new spreadsheet
The tutor also couldn't get his computer connected up and had to leave it for a while until someone came to fix all the issues so it did feel a bit unorganized
Lunch was ok but I don't think there was enough food as all of the sandwiches were eaten
There was no cold drinks with lunch and no sweet things apart from yogurts, lunch overall was a bit disappointing
The laptops were a bit troublesome - some of them didn't have a licenced copy of excel on them, this probably should have been checked prior to the start of the day
Also the big screen hadn't been set up for Mitchell to use, and someone only came to fix it over an hour into the course
The only slight issue with the training were the IT glitches
A little colour in the training material would make it more interesting
The lunch was not good in the slightest
The soup was luke warm and tasteless
The sandwiches had been sitting out for a while as the bread was hard
There was not enough food for us all, still hungry after
I am involved in risk management but not in the business side so a lot of the terminology went straight over my head
I understand the course is pitched at people above my pay grade so it can't be dumbed down for people like me but maybe a glossary would be useful
may have been useful to have had a number of risk assessments to look at
However the page numbers were missing, so referring back to it or at specific points was difficult
Unfortunately, I'm a picky eater and didn't like any of the options
Perhaps smaller groups / individual focus could benefit further
This course needs reviewing and updating for more modern technology + practises
first rate!  There was a few computer glitches on the day, which took up a bit of time to sort and would have been better if the hardware was tested in advance
The online payment method didn't work too well, but maybe just me
I was hoping to pay by visa over the phone as most businesses accept that method
I felt the afternoon session was rushed, especially when we had stated that internal negotiation was a key point of the day
I was told by reception that i could not park in the car park and had to pay for parking at the Wellgreen car park
i didn't eat the lunch provided , i went outside the facility to get my own so my rating on lunch isn't a valid one
My only negative about the course was I found it very restrictive being in the one room all day from 9am until 4
30pm  - it would be more ideal to have the catering in another area so that you get to leave the training area for a short while
There were a few errors on some of the slides (and in the handout) which need amended
It would also have been useful to have had the formulae for financial ratios on the slides
We were in suite 4A , the photocopier was being used and was a little distracting
I really struggled when asked to do the exercise and when I asked the trainer for support I still didn't have a clue what I was doing
I am not sure the blind folded building/dismantling part of the course was the best use of our time
I think doing it once would have been enough for everyone to understand from all parts sides
I would have perhaps liked some more diagrams of the models Joe talked about but to be fair I understand these may follow later this week
Some warning beforehand that it would be only myself and the trainer would have been helpful, mainly as the emails I received before made me expect that there would be a group of people for the training so I wasn't expecting it to be that intense being 1 on 1
Felt it was too general - to share best practice with colleagues would have been more beneficial
Just wish we had more time
There seemed to be a lot of content we were unable to cover or just skimmed over due to time
I felt I benefited more from the assertiveness course
The Negotiation course I felt I covered most of this in my day to day to role
Needed more paper to write on (this may have been the hotels fault), print outs of the presentation would have been helpful
I think engagement before the training session in terms of what everyone wants to get out of it is really important so that the trainer understands how the core principles of the training work within our organisation
The trainer should make a greater effort to include all members of the team
Demonstrations could be more engaging
We were told the course would start at 9 but on arrival at the venue we were told it started at 10
Also, we finished at lunchtime on the second day so it wasn't really a 2 day course
As mentioned earlier the exercises needed more role play to drive home the key message of the course
The main problem was the materials of the course that in my opinion was too basic and not in line
It was also a lot of presentation through Powerpoint which doesn't necessarily create debates and discussion with the group to be able to share best practices and knowledge
There was some pre-reading for the course but I never received it
There were extra documents at the end that you could take away for further reading but there was not enough for everyone
I don't feel that I have been equipped with additional tools
To make it more applicable & easier to apply in an everyday context, some real life case studies from our roles could have been used as examples and discussed in detail
The only downside as expressed earlier I thought there would be more risk assessment part of the training
There was  a few issue with the projector
The only thing I would change is that staff are asked to provide examples of actual spreadsheets they work with
5 of the laptops did not work properly and I think the attendees would have benefitted from a short summary of the work we carried out on the day rather than a 145 page booklet
Re the course materials, whilst they covered the topics on the agenda there were a couple of typos in the materials (paper and presentations) that could be corrected
Therefore the majority of the content was not entirely relevant to my cause for attending and was not new to me
The only negative for me was the role play, it just felt awkward at times and didn't help me practice the skills properly
As above, a bit thin on the ground
The training materials arrived whilst I was in my course so I didn't get to use them
my only criticism of the course is about the handouts
some of the slides were a bit small and hard to read
However the facility may need expansion to cope if more companies inhabit the office space
However I do feel that the training was almost trying to scare us
No mention of contracts/consent etc
A lot of scare tactics
No idea what the role of the facilitator was - he opened the door when people were locked out - that seemed to be it
Would have liked much more specific training related to Home Start rather than a blanket 'your Policies are not fit for purpose'
I felt he was trying to frighten us! Not as specific to our organisation as I would've liked
A step by step guide to what we need to do would have been better
No course materials have been received to date
The lunch was OK; sandwiches and orange juice
No on street free parking as described in prior course communications
Course materials were inadequate - we were only given a handout of powerpoint presentation, nothing else, no info or guidelines
I would have expected much more in the way of handouts and take-home materials/references for the cost of the course
As with all such training there is such a wealth of information that delegates cannot hope to note everything, and more comprehensive reading material would have been very welcome
Room on second day was a bit claustrophobic
Lunch was very poor, however that would not normally be an issue for me personally, but feedback is important, it was poor
Warm food would have been better
Lunch was very limited I didn't actually eat anything except for a 1/4 of a sandwich
The lunch wasn't great as there was only sandwiches I don't eat bread so i didn't have a lunch
Would be great if you had a choice i
The actually material was a little 'light' but maybe necessary for only a one day course
The main thing that let the experience down was the fact there was only one other delegate on the course, who was very new to the role
I found this very limiting as there was no one to learn from or share ideas with
I believe more knowledge and insight would have been gained if more attendees were on the course to take part in the case studies and activities
Would have preferred more time on plain English as this section of the course was delivered at a very quick pace
Tailoring it to architectural presentations would be helpful because architects use a lot of graphics for presentations
more of a 'workshop' would have been beneficial
A 1 hour time slot felt quite short for the material to be covered in detail
There was insufficient time to cover all the topics listed
Would have liked to cover more content, possibly over 2 days
No Vegan choice on the Menu and a little more choice for Vegetarians would be lovely
I am gravely concerned at this advice being given
There had been a communication issue regarding the set up of a TV for the delivery of the presentation resulting in it not being set up
However to go on and on about it for 3 hours became ridiculous
I am afraid they revealed this side of them on this occasion
The trainer could have done better by listening and understanding questions posed by the group in order to answer more satisfactorily
The trainer gave us an answer but we, the training group, did not feel that this was appropriate for our workplace
We essentially disagreed with the answer she gave us, and we said so, but the trainer didn't understand what we were saying and didn't try to explain or explore this in order to reach a better conclusion to the question
Also i found the trainer gave too many examples of her own personal experiences and successes, which weren't always useful to the topic
The examples she used could have been more constructive and inclusive
I would have preferred that the trainer was more focused in her exploration of each topic so that the time could have been used more effectively
I feel that this was terrible advice but also a classist comment to make
There was one comment made towards the end of the course which I found a bit strange and which I disagreed with
While I understand the point Mary was making, I thought the choice of example was unfortunate as made comment on peoples social background and therefore how they would speak/understand information
I found this stereotyping inappropriate to the training and in hindsight quite offensive on a personal level
I don't doubt this wasn't the intended affect, but worth consideration for future training events as could be perceived as very judgmental
We have not received the 'materials'
During the session we did not go through it
The booking was complex because of administration on my organisation's side
It was tiring
All there was for lunch was a bowl of tomato soup and bread roll
Having had time for no breakfast that morning i was starving in the afternoon even after the bowl of soup and bread roll
Felt the lunch while it was tasty could have been more substantial
I felt there was a lot of wasted time and a lot of time spent discussing time management and satisfaction of home life and not enough time focusing on how to better manage your time and  completion of tasks required at work
Overall I felt the course could have been covered in 1/2 a day not a full day
I think the booking process could be smoother as I'd booked to go on this course 6 months ago and after 2 cancellations had to travel to Newcastle (instead of Leeds where it had initially been booked for)
I learned very little that I feel I can apply in practice
The course was largely made up of the trainer reading the slides aloud
Course materials consisted of a powerpoint presentation that was at best difficult to read, and often completely illegible due to text size, colour choices and the size of the screen
This was ironic given the subject matter!  We were given hard copies of the presentation, which are also illegible in parts
Lunch was a small number of sandwiches
Lunch was OK - on the sandwich front they should make it clear that if you want chicken and mayonnaise you also get this with salad in the sandwich, which some people may not like
Hand out file could be improved by way of dividers & index
Lunch was quite good but a shame there was no hot option
Less theory and more practical tips would be useful
An overview of IT packages which are useful to PAs would be welcome
Acceptable room for the two candidates, though it was stuffy
Lunch just passable
I think it would have been useful to have the course materials on the day
I have not had a chance to see the course materials yet so have not commented on their usefulness
I don't think we received the correct training course
The lunch was okay but the portion size was very small
The Idea Factory is still a very new building in a new complex so it felt that we were out on our own
The facilities there are adequate but I am sure they will improve in time
Room was a bit too warm
No hot food available for lunch
A little quick at times which made it a hard to follow and we finished early so we would have had the time to take it a little slower
Had a problem parking
A summarised slide of the main changes between 2007 and 2015 CDM regs would have been useful
Content would need to be tailored to our GMP for other groups that are not familiar with the topic and their duties
Setting early finish expectations at the start did not necessarily set the right tone for the participants
Would perhaps like a little more detail on best practice examples for what should be included in a project's Pre Construction Information and its Construction Phase (Health and Safety) Plan
The room was tiny and felt a bit cramped
The catering was also left unrefreshed until the venue was reminded that this had been requested
Unfortunately, despite talks with someone beforehand, there was no gluten or dairy free lunch provided so I had to look for a place nearby to cater
We were also expecting regular top ups of coffee and tea at 10am and 3pm and had to keep phoning Reception who didn't seem bothered about it
The room was extremely small
The course is very generic
It could have been improved by making it more tailored to what is done at Ineos Grangemouth
Lunch should have more options
A hot food option would have been better
No sugar for coffee
However a small improvement point, that came out at the end of the training is regarding the handouts which were give to us at every step of the training
It would be much better if they were already present in the folder we receive in the beginning, having numbers or clear ways to locate them in the folder
From the time of booking the course I have received numerous emails for courses which have no significance to me
Would have liked a more in-depth course, perhaps with a practical element
I booked my hotel where I was lead to believe the course was being held as all previous communications had mentioned the Holiday Inn at Waterloo Square but when the confirmation came through it strayed that the course was being held elsewhere
I was a little frustrated this change hadn't been communicated
invoice details incorrect etc
Not overly concerned personally  but you need to get this right to be as professional as you can be and make the experience as issue free as possible
It would have been good to understand some more of the content agenda prior to the session
The fact that there were 3 of us from the one organisation I found a bit inhibiting, I would probably have asked more specific questions if there had been no-one there who knew my team (however the trainer did point out to us all that anything that was said should be treated as confidential)
One aspect I found less useful what the feedback session
I felt uncomfortable writing down comments regarding things that a person could do differently (better), and having those comments passed around the whole team to read
I would have preferred to have time with each team member to say these things privately and in person
My only negative would be that parking was difficult/expensive
More practise sessions would be useful
Room temperature was significantly low
Not having a break-out space to have a lunch was unusual
Facilities overall were disappointing
No tea/coffee or water provided for lunch?
The training room on day one was ice cold with no heating
Everyone complained about this
The room was quiet cold need more heaters but otherwise satisfied
However, I would have liked a risk assessment
The facilities were ok, but the room was cold for most of the morning but a good size for the number on the course
With the booking process we had some difficulty getting the discount for multiple attendees, but the team were very helpful any time I got in contact
The course material seemed to be odds and sods from other courses that hadn't really been prepared in advance of this course
The only downside to the venue and facilities was the heating within the training room / building
Some grammatical errors in the presentation in relation to scearios
Use of a previous presentations notes
Lunch was very basic
Not enough for 4
Some slides within the presentation were not covered during the training but the reason for this was not explained
Booklet was a waste of resources and wasn't used once during the training, nor has it been used afterwards
The folder and printed out materials were a waste of the earths resources
There were no elements of the training which required note taking, or any content which was worth reflection afterwards
Therefore, handing out folders and printed notes is perhaps unnecessary
The training didn't seem to incorporate what HES advisors actually do on a day to day basis
The book handed out was completely pointless
Overall I wasn't that impressed with the course
Some of the material handed out was not correctly formatted and the trainer had to provide copies of his material so it made sense
I feel slides were just quickly skimmed over and I don't feel I learned anything outstanding
I feel the fee does not reflect the time (being reduced to 1 day) or the experience
I would have expected a discount with the reduction in days
Perhaps if the course had lasted two days then these would have been covered
As a result I left the course feeling a little short changed although I had picked up a couple of new project planning techniques
I think my company have grounds for a partial refund given the course was cut by one day
At the end of the first day was a bit confused about the linear steps of process
A sheet providing list of all the shortcuts would be very useful for people who are not used to using shortcut keys when working in Word
the room was not ready for us to start training which was an unnecessary delay of waiting in reception
The room was very small and too warm by the afternoon
The chairs were also very slippery! I know there were staff changes so hiccups are to be expected but it would have been smoother if we had been told to bring a prepared presentation as the trainer expected
The toilets in the facility weren't clean and very grotty
I was given wrong information on the location of the training which caused a lot of frustration and anxiety and took up a lot of time
Lack of car parking facilities
I think there could be more content to actually teach you what you should be doing, I feel we were practicing to gain confidence but not learning many new skills/tactics
Although I appreciate that the invoices get automatically generated on a certain date this makes it hard to claim back expenses which are sitting on my credit card
Communication more in advance that it was just the 2 of us would have been better
It's hard to know what 'intermediate' means
I possibly would have liked more information on using pivot tables
It would have been useful to have a handout or workbook at the end of the course for practice purposes and consolidating the learning when you return to your own desk
I think the course should not be run with less that 4 delegates
Thought the course could have been shorter
Crusts on the sandwiches were a little chewy
trying to demonstrate skills learned in the role play parts felt a little force and unnatural
Rooms on day 1 and 3 weren't the best as there was no windows
I did not enjoy the course, but in saying that I recognise that the other delegates did
For me personally, it didn't suit my style of learning
I very much dislike breaking away into small groups and some days it felt that all we were doing was breaking out
I also struggle with all day sessions
I feel there was certainly scope to have shorter, intensive, sessions (say 9am to 1pm)
Many of our sessions were disturbed by others having to dip out to take calls, using their laptops to answer emails and coming back late from breaks
If the sessions were shorter, I think it would be easier for people to concentrate, knowing that they can catch up with work later in the day
I also think that there should be a ban on those attending from having their laptops open on the table
Breaking out into small groups with one member of that group on their laptop, is both rude and disconcerting
Could of ate more
The trainer was ill-informed at the start of the day of who exactly we were
I would have like more opportunity to test out my coaching skills
The service could have been better
Facilities were very low grade
Toilets were even uncleaned
Room was far too small for number of people, very squashed, no space
The laptops were old & dirty
The kitchen was a bit cold!!
I didn't give the facilities 5 stars as the data projector on day 2 was extremely noisy and needed to be drop kicked out of the room!
He was loaded with a cold and I felt this took his attention away somewhat
I don't feel he went into the details as much as he could have
The trainer told a lot of stories and I'm not sure they contributed much to the experience
By no means was wowed by the course and don't feel I took a huge amount of knowledge away from it
I was hoping for more detail on dealing with project management issues and problems and how to resolve them
Other closeby meeting rooms could be heard so perhaps the soundproofing of the rooms could be improved
