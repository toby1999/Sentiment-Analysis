Plenty of information on booklet provided by trainer
usually I struggle on day courses in the afternoon , but my concentration was good all day and took a huge amount from the day which has linked in to my ILAM level 3 apprenticeship which I am  currently  completing

Having the insights report as part of this training was invaluable as well as being a added extra that you can really study and understand who you are as a manager
Marion Letham is a fantastic trainer, we gained so much from our 2 day session with her
She is very approachable, friendly and encouraging
Her insights and knowledge on this topic were top notch
I will be recommending that other new managers in our organisation complete this course and indeed that we re-use Marion as a trainer on other related courses
I felt the course content and materials were suited to the course, easy to follow
Used a range of approaches and methods which were thought provoking
Gave physical steps to implementing initiatives
Excellent course
Martin set the scene from the outset, specifying the learning outcomes but also taking on board any other related aspects we as a group wanted to get out of the course
The small group worked extremely well together, a bonding experience, complimented by Martin
We were learning constantly and seemed to cover so much ground but in-depth, nothing was considered of less value
The practical side of the course was invaluable, thought provoking and really well structured
The trainer conducted himself well and I liked his style of teaching
Really impressed with the content and the trainer

The day flew, and I came out highly motivated to make changes, and have been doing so already!
The course however was great, the tutor was brilliant and very engaging
These were dealt with well by Mitch, he was able to keep it going and fix IT issues at the same time

Good overall course, teacher was very clear and gave the points across well
Good course with good participation from all - everybody's opinions were respected equally

It will help me greatly in my role as a Supervisor to use and develop these coaching skills to improve and grow the capability of my shift in a positive manner where people will feel empowered and valued
It was clear Martin had a solid grounding on the course and was able to give good reasoning and detail with every step of the topic
Questions were answered in a style that was clear and to the point
It was a good interactive experience, carried out in a way that did not make it awkward
As I said before helped me open up understanding of how much skills involved in training and how developing these skills will make me a better coach
It was very good
This was not what I expected the course to be, internally we had been offered a facilitating course, but regardless I picked up some useful techniques and ways to consider meetings so it did achieve some of what I was after
I found the course useful & interesting overall
I thought the trainer had a great knowledge of the material and he infused his own experiences into the class

I thought the training course was very well organised and I was pleased with the overall training and outcome
The trainer was very good and clearly knowledgeable
I would just like to Thank Vidette for all her hard work and effort , she made everything so understanding and I have took a lot back to my work place from being on the course

Location was fantastic as close to the train station
I thought the trainer was superb
Lunch was a good quality
Great choice of food
Tea, Coffee and biscuits provided throughout the day
Modern training facilities
I thought the course was better than other project management courses I have been on, mostly due to the knowledge and experiences of Brian and also how the course was tailored to everyone's needs and not just running through a PowerPoint to get all areas covered
Coffee and quality biscuits were available most of the day - very good
Very happy with booking process, facilities and particularly nice lunch
All in all facilities, instructor and material as well as the food were first class
The communication prior to the course was excellent
In general I really enjoyed the course and found it very useful
Timing was perfect as I had a presentation to do 2 days after
Facilities were ideal for the number of delegates, felt like a classroom workshop rather than a course, so perfect size
Course was excellent and everything I expected it to be
The lunch provided was excellent
The tray-bakes at the beginning of the course were excellent
Margaret ran the course well and clearly was very familiar with the subject matter
She was able to provide advice and techniques which I am sure will be helpful going forward
Good folder of handouts to take away and refer back too
The course has made me refocus and certainly readopt and apply proof reading skills
Great course and was suitable for everyone - we all had different experience, weak areas etc
and I think everyone will have got something from the course
I thoroughly enjoyed this training and benefited from the course content
I am happy there are materials that I can refer too as there was a lot on the day to try and remember (with my notes being inadequate when I looked back at them)
I will use the techniques in my day to day role and know it will assist me greatly
Freshly prepared and suited my dietary needs
If i am looking for training for myself or my going forward I would look at Cosensa website to check their offerings
Lunch was absolutely fine, my allergy was dealt with perfectly (I often have problems) cheers!

Thank you for providing such a useful and engaging course
A very informative course, which helps give not only an understanding of the business requirements, but also helps reflect on your own personal style and handling of situations
The personal profiling was very interesting, although not surprising helped when looking at the assignments and giving a different perspective
I have already recommended this programme to colleagues, and have no hesitation of doing so in the future, it have been very beneficial
A well rounded-course offering a fountain of information and knowledge
A very enjoyable course at a good pace
The course was great!, one of the best ones I have done with Cake so far
The contents were relevant and it was useful to talk about ourselves as leaders and to be able to increase our self awareness on the topic
It was also really useful to talk about the difference between a manager and a leader and understand the dynamic between the two
Hope to see you again soon!
Great course - even if you don't have the opportunity to coach anyone you feel well prepared after this course and it helps develop your listening skills
This programme was all that I expected it to be
very informative course and a good reminder of ways to coach staff and when coaching crosses over into more mentoring

Excellent course - we all really enjoyed it and got a lot from it
Thoroughly enjoyed it and with having a managerial role within my previous role prior to Kinnerton it is a long while since I have attended a course like this, it was great to brush up on my skills and also learn new ones
I really enjoyed this course, and got a lot out of it
Initially I was going to attend this course with colleagues from work, but I am actually glad that I did not, as participating in a course with wide and varied experiences was beneficial
